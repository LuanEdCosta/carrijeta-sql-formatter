# :page_facing_up: Carrijeta SQL Formatter

This project helps the [Unicode Software](https://www.unicodesoftware.com.br/ "Unicode Software Homepage") Team to format their SQL queries automatically.
They use Delphi to build complex softwares and their code editor doesn't provide many tools acelerate the development process and to maintain the quality of the code, so all these things need to be done manually.

## :heart: Motivation

I always wanted to create something that they can use in their daily routine of development and help me when I need to code in Delphi.
